# Responsive-Portfolio
Portfolio created to display past and current projects. The projects displayed are from my time at Trilogy Full Stack Boot Camp via The University of Richmond. The goal of this portfolio structure in particular was to display a responsive design using media queries.
This portfolio includes about fifteen or more projects such as word games, gif generators using API calls, a messaging app called ChatSpace, a train schedule made with JavaScript and other activities.
The portfolio also includes my email: ashlie86.2003@yahoo.com
